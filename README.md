# multiplayerMario

A multiplayer Mario platform game utilizing a server and multiple client threads to communicate and interact with one another. It is a program created by Team BACKK, which consists of me and three fellow classmates.

# How to Run the Program

The Server.jar file must be run before the Runner.jar file can connect. 

The IP address and port number in ClientThread.java and Server.java should be changed if necessary. Previously hardcoded IP and port are only suitable for use within the R.I.T. network. 

Offline gameplay is available regardless of IP or port configurations.

# How to Play Multiplayer Mario: 

The goal of multiplayer Mario is to finish the level the fastest while collecting as many items aka “coins” as you possibly can! Each character has three lives and there are obstacles along the way that your character must maneuver and hop over include green tubes, landing blocks, and fly traps. 

## Basic Controls
	A to move your character backwards 
	D to move your character forwards 
	S to make your character crouch 
	SPACE - BAR to jump
	E to shoot fireballs

To collect items your character must touch the item blocks (the golden block with a question mark) with your character in order to get an item coin. 

Along the way there are also mobs, if your character touches a mob you will be damaged. Once you lose enough health points you will lose a life. Luckily you are able to shoot fireballs at them!
